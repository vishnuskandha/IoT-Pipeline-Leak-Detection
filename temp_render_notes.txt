# Start Frontend in foreground (on the port Render assigns, usually $PORT)
# Note: Streamlit on Render needs specific configuration, but for a single Web Service, 
# we usually expose the Streamlit port.
# If we want both accessible, it's tricky on one free service.
# BETTER APPROACH FOR RENDER FREE TIER:
# Deploy generic "Web Service" for the Backend (API).
# Deploy "Static Site" or another "Web Service" for Streamlit? No, Streamlit needs python.

# REVISED PLAN DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT YET.
# Render Free Tier allows multiple web services.
# Best Stability: Deploy Backend as Web Service 1. Deploy Frontend as Web Service 2.
# But for "Easy", let's try to run them together?
# No, externally accessing port 8000 (API) and 8501 (UI) on one Render service is not possible (only 1 port exposed).

# SOLUTION:
# We will setup for TWO separate services on Render (both free).
# Service 1 (Backend): Command `uvicorn backend:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
# Service 2 (Frontend): Command `streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT --server.address 0.0.0.0`
